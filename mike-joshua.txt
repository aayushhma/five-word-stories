Once upon a time, there
was a controversy of note.
It just so happened that
people were eating too many
frogs and had begun to
forget how to count.
For example, when going to
the local patisserie in search of
some delicious cake to eat
they'd confuse quatre and cinq
with cent and mille regretfullyy.

The upshot of all this
was people around the globe
became more friendly, if overweight.
